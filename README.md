This repository contains our implementation of **PFCA**.

### Data Format
The patient EHR data, **features** is formatted as 
```
[sample_num * tensor(1, feature_num)]
```
The **label** is formatted as
```
[sample_num * tensor(1, target_num)]
```
The graph data like **path_index**, which represents paths extracted from the personalized knowledge graphs (PKGs), is formatted as
```
tensor(sample_num, visit_num, feature_num, path_num)
```

### Benchmark Datasets

* [MIMIC-III](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/)
* [MIMIC-IV](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/3.0/)

### External Medical Knowledge Graph

* [UMLS](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/index.html)

### Data Preprocess
```
Data/
├── mimic-iii/
│   ├── ...
├── mimic-iv/
│   ├── ...
├── UMLS/
│   ├── ...
├── datapreprocess_iii_kg.py

```
As is shown above, please store the downloaded MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV data in the "mimic-iii" and "mimic-iv" directories within the "Data" folder. Similarly, place the UMLS knowledge graph in the "UMLS" directory inside the "Data" folder. 

#### Processing Knowledge Graph
To process the knowledge graph, use `datapreprocess_iii_kg.py` and `datapreprocess_iv_kg.py`. Run the corresponding Python file to generate the adjacency matrix of the knowledge graph based on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets:
1. For MIMIC-III adjacency matrix:
`python datapreprocess_iii_kg.py`
2. For MIMIC-IV adjacency matrix:
`python datapreprocess_iii_kg.py`

### Processing MIMIC Datasets
After processing the knowledge graph, use datapreprocess_iii.py and datapreprocess_iv.py to process MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets. Specify the task using the `--task` parameter. Available tasks are as follows:
1. `diagnosis_prediction`
2. `medication_recommendation`
3. `readmission_prediction`

For example, to process the MIMIC-III dataset for diagnosis prediction:

`python datapreprocess_iii.py --task diagnosis_prediction`
